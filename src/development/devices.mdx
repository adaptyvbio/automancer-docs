# Standardized devices [outdated]


## Introduction

{Brand} provides a mechanism to manage devices and make it possible for units to build upon each other. For instance, in the case of a USB device, three units could work together:

1. a low-level unit communicates to the USB driver and provides a low-level interface in the form of binary I/O;
2. a mid-level unit elevates the low-level interface to a higher level in the form of high-level commands;
3. a high-level unit provides tools to simplify working with this interface, for example by grouping such commands.

In this context, a device is not necessarily a physical device connected to the computer. It could also be a remotely controlled device, or just a virtual object which is convenient to consider a device.


## Recipes

### Creating a device

A device is referenced by its identifier which must be unique among all devices and units. A minimal device implementation only needs to implement the identifier as the `self.id` attribute to be valid.

```py
class TempSensor:
  def __init__(self):
    self.id = 'temp_sensor1'

sensor = TempSensor()
host.devices[sensor.id] = sensor
```

The device is registered on the `host.devices` dictionary using its identifier. In a more realistic example, the id `temp_sensor1` would provided by the user as part of setup's configuration.

Unfortunately, in this example, the device won't be usuable by other units as it does not use a common interface. Instead, it can be made to inherit `NodeDevice` and provide a standard interface in the `self.nodes` attribute.

```py
from pr1.device import NodeDevice

class TempSensor(NodeDevice):
  def __init__(self):
    self.id = 'temp_sensor1'
    self.nodes = [NumericNode(type='f32')]

    def update_callback(value):
      self.nodes[0].value = value

    start_sensor_somethow(update_callback)
```

### Reading from a device

A consumer unit can use the device using the same `host.devices` dictionary used to create devices.

```py
sensor = host.devices['temp_sensor1']

# Get the last known value.
sensor.nodes[0].value

# Fetch the current value.
await sensor.nodes[0].read()
```

Listening to the device's nodes is done by calling `node.listen()`. Certain devices have optimization for listening to changes but others device will just poll the value repeatedly.

```py
node = sensor.nodes[0]
print("Initial value", node.value)

while True:
  value = await node.listen()
  print("New value", value)
```

### Batch-reading from a device

Multiple nodes can be read from the same device in a single call. Certain devices have optimization for batch-reading but others device will just read requested values individually.

```py
# These are identical
values = await sensor.read(0b011001)
values = await sensor.read([0, 3, 4])
values = await sensor.read([sensor.nodes[0], sensor.nodes[3], sensor.nodes[4]])
```

The same is possible for listening to values.

```py
values = await sensor.listen(0b011001)
# etc.
```
