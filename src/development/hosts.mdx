## Internal stuff

There are multiple ways to

- Local
  - **Alpha** – The server is a single, embedded and opaque directory which contains a copy of Python and a set of packages, including units. It is usually generated by [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/). This approach is for production environments.
  - **Beta** – The server relies on a local copy of Python, its packages and an additional, embedded directory of packages, including built-in units. The Python instance can be a virtual environment in order to keep unit installation separate from the main Python installation. This approach is for development and production environments that have Python installed.
  - **Gamma** (Windows only) – The server relies on the [embedded distribution of Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package), its packages and an embedded directory of packages. This approach is for development and production environments that run Windows and do not have Python installed.
- Remote
  - **Delta** – The server is on another computer.
- Web
  - **Epsilon** – The server relies on a [https://pyodide.org/](Pyodide) instance. Its packages are "installed" using Micropip from a `requirements.txt` file part of the host's configuration.

In addition to these,

Every setup has a configuration which specifies which Python binary to use, which in turns provides a list of modules to be loaded. For most applications, the default user Python implementation is sufficient as long as its version is 3.10 or later. This setting is handled by the application running the setup, usually the user interface.
