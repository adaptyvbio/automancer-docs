import { Brand } from '../shared';

export const title = 'Module development';


# {title}


## Getting started with the simple template

The easiest way to get started is by copying the template unit provided in the {Brand} code repository, in the `units/template` repository. You can start by replacing all instances of `simple` with the name of your unit.

This template unit provides both a backend and frontend, however feel free to remove the frontend if it is not needed. Furthermore, the frontend includes styles, which are needed in most cases. The frontend relies on [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) instead of regular JSX such that it doesn't require any preprocessing.

To test the unit, install it in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs). This will add the package to the Python import path through a symbolic link.

```sh
$ pip install -e .
```

The unit will be loaded by default, however it can be useful to load it in development mode by editing the setup's configuration (TODO: Add a anchor link).


## Getting started with the advanced template

Unlike the unit above, this template includes npm scripts to preprocess source code of the frontend:

- Scripts are written in TSX (TypeScript+JSX) which is bundled and compiled to JavaScript.
- Styles are written in SCSS which is compiled to CSS.

This configuration requires Node.js to run appropriate preprocessors.

The provided npm scripts ensure that the generated files will be at the correct location for the Python package to function. They can be triggered by running `npm run build` after installing dependencies with `npm install`, in the `client` directory.


## Unit structure


### Components

At its core, a unit is a Python object (usually a module) referenced by [an entry point](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html) named `pr1.units`. This object corresponds to the unit's backend and is the main extension a unit provides. It can do anything a typical Python program could do: interact with devices, make HTTP requests, write files, etc.

In addition to this, a unit can contain a frontend to add custom UI elements to the application. These can go from simple icons and labels to full views used to manually control certain devices or report sensor data. Complex components are written in the form of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components.

Components should preferably use style classes of the standard application to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application. However, they can also import their own CSS through the `styleSheets` extension point.

Here is a list of the various extension points that a unit can or should implement:

- **Backend**
  - `Executor` (optional) – The main class of a unit which handles the unit's configuration and communication with devices. There is a single executor instance per unit.
  - `Parser` (optional) – A class providing syntax extensions to protocols. There is a single parser per protocol per unit, which is re-created each time the protocol is changes.
  - `Runner` (optional) – A class holding the unit's configuration with respect to a chip and triggering actions when a protocol is running. There is a single runner instance per chip and per unit.
  - `client_path` (optional) – The path to the unit's frontend entry point. All files in the directory and subdirectories will also be made available for requests by the frontend.
  - `metadata` – An instance of `pr1.base.Metadata` which provides information about the unit.
  - `namespace` – The unit's name.
- **Frontend** (optional, only if `client_path` is provided by the backend)
  - `MatrixEditor` (optional)
  - `createFeatures()` (optional) – A function providing a list of icon and label pairs, known as _features_, that describe the unit's functionality during a segment.
  - `getGeneralTabs()` (optional) – A function providing a list of tabs to be displayed the sidebar.
  - `getChipTabs()` (optional) – A function providing a list of tabs to be displayed in the chip view.
  - `namespace` – The unit's name.
  - `styleSheets` (optional) – An array of [`CSSStyleSheet` objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet) to be loaded with the unit. A common way of providing such objects is by using [CSS Module Scripts](https://web.dev/css-module-scripts/).


### Examples

This section lists examples of which extension points a unit would typically implement, excluding `metadata` which is mandatory and `client_path` which is necessary in the presence of a frontend.

- **Provide support for an ordinary device**
  - Backend
    - `Executor` – Processes the device's configuration (e.g. address) and communicates with it through a third-party API (e.g. pySerial).
    - `Parser` – Parses the protocol attributes responsible for writing to the device.
    - `Runner` – Takes the data generated by the parser and passes it to the executor when a relevant segment is running.
  - Frontend
    - `createFeatures()` – Provides a feature for the device's action.
    - `getGeneralTabs()` / `getChipTabs()` (optional) – Adds a manual control UI that communicates with the executor or runner, respectively.
- **Provide support for a device supported by the standardized API**, such as list of binary inputs
  - Backend
    - `Executor` – Processes the configuration and communicates with the device.
- **Provide a syntax extension to protocols**, such as loops
  - Backend
    - `Parser` – Parses the syntax extension.
- **Provide functionality independently of an experiment and protocol**, such as allowing to remotely download files generated by other units
  - Backend
    - `Executor` – Provides this new functionality.
  - Frontend
    - `getGeneralTabs()` – Provides a UI for the new functionality.

Many built-in features of the application are in fact provided by units: experiment metadata, built-in protocol constructs, timers, etc.


### File structure

The file structure of a typical unit with a frontend is as follows:

```
.
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.py
├── client
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── dist (generated)
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── src
│       └── index.tsx
└── pr1_ksp
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── client -> ../../client/dist
    ├── executor.py
    └── matrix.py
```

The symbolic link of the generated frontend files makes it possible to embed these file in the associated Python package.



## Unit development mode


### Introduction

When developing units, it can be cumbersome to reload the software each time you make a change to the unit's source code, be it on the backend or the frontend. To speed up the development process, such units can be loaded in _development mode_, which provides the following features:

- Pressing Alt+R reloads the unit's frontend.
- Pressing Ctrl+R reloads the unit's backend.
- Pressing Alt+Ctrl+R reloads both.


### Enabling the development mode

The development mode must be activated individually to units in the setup configuration.

```yml
units:
  ksp:
    development: true
    options: ...
```


### Effects of reloading the backend

Reloading the backend will have many specific effects:

- All Python modules which are children of the unit's entry point module will be reloaded using [`importlib.reload()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload). For example if the unit's entry point is the `science.ksp` module, then `science.ksp` and all its submodules (i.e. `science.ksp.*`) will be reloaded. Dependencies of these modules that do no match this pattern will not be reloaded.
- The existing executor, if any, will be destroyed.
- A new executor will be created and initialized if the unit provides an `Executor` class.
- If the user is currently working on a draft protocol, this draft will be re-compiled to make use of the updated parser, if any.
- All chips will be unserialized again, therefore their runners will be recreated and their condition might change if the responsible runner was reloaded.

Reloading comes with important caveats:

- Files imported by the entry frontend file will not be reloaded, including style sheets.

If things do not behave as expected after reloading, restarting the application will likely resolve most issues.

Units that do not provide a Python module as entry point cannot be reloaded.


### Effects of reloading the frontend

Reloading the frontend will cause the app to [`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) the unit's client again. A query parameter with a timestamp with millisecond resolution (e.g. `?1660675147822`) will be appended to the request URL to avoid caching.

The current state of the unit's components will be discarded. Unwanted effects should be minimal as the state of each component should be kept contained and devoid of side effects.



## Extension points


### Creating custom general tabs

Units can create custom tabs on the sidebar by providing a `getGeneralTabs()` function. This function should return an array of navigation entries with the following properties:

- `id` – The identifier of the tab. It will be shared across other units, therefore it is a good practice to prefix it with the unit's namespace.
- `label` – The tab's label.
- `icon` – A mandatory icon for the tab.
- `component` – The component to render when the tab is selected.

The props passed to this component are the following:

- `host` – The current host.
- `setRoute(route)` – A function to set the current route.

This code sample shows how the corresponding TypeScript types.

```tsx
import { GeneralTabComponentProps, NavEntry } from 'pr1';

export function getGeneralTabs(): NavEntry<GeneralTabComponentProps> {
  return [
    {
      id: 'ksp.rocket',
      label: 'Rocket',
      icon: 'rocket',
      component: RocketTab
    }
  ];
}

export function RocketTab(props: GeneralTabComponentProps) {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Rocket</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```


### Creating custom chip tabs

Units can also create custom tabs in the chip view by providing a `getChipTabs()` function, in a similar way to general tabs.

```tsx
import { ChipTabComponentProps, NavEntry } from 'pr1';

export function getChipTabs(chip: Chip): NavEntry<ChipTabComponentProps> {
  return [
    {
      id: 'ksp.rocket',
      label: 'Rocket',
      icon: 'rocket',
      disabled: false,
      component: RocketTab
    }
  ];
}

export function RocketTab(props: ChipTabComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Rocket</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The props passed to this component are the following:

- `chipId` – The current chip's id.
- `host` – The current host.
- `setRoute(route)` – A function to set the current route.

This code sample shows how the corresponding TypeScript types.

Unlike general tabs, chip tabs can be disabled depending on the chip's status.

```tsx
export function getChipTabs(chip: Chip): NavEntry<ChipTabComponentProps> {
  return [
    {
      // ...
      disabled: chip.runners.ksp.rocketStatus === 'offline'
    }
  ];
}
```
