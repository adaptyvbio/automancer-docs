{/* ## Getting started with the simple template

The easiest way to get started is by copying the template unit provided in the {Brand} code repository, in the `units/template` repository. You can start by replacing all instances of `simple` with the name of your unit.

This template unit provides both a backend and frontend, however feel free to remove the frontend if it is not needed. Furthermore, the frontend includes styles, which are needed in most cases. The frontend relies on [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) instead of regular JSX such that it doesn't require any preprocessing.

To test the unit, install it in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs). This will add the package to the Python import path through a symbolic link.

```sh
$ pip install -e .
```

The unit will be loaded by default, however it can be useful to load it in development mode by editing the setup's configuration (TODO: Add a anchor link).


## Getting started with the advanced template

Unlike the unit above, this template includes npm scripts to preprocess source code of the frontend:

- Scripts are written in TSX (TypeScript+JSX) which is bundled and compiled to JavaScript.
- Styles are written in SCSS which is compiled to CSS.

This configuration requires Node.js to run appropriate preprocessors.

The provided npm scripts ensure that the generated files will be at the correct location for the Python package to function. They can be triggered by running `npm run build` after installing dependencies with `npm install`, in the `client` directory. */}
