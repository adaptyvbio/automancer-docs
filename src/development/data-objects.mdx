## Description

Modules that deal with data usually consume and produce _data objects_, opaque objects that can be defined by one of the following Python objects:

- An absolute or relative path which implements the `os.PathLike` interface.
- A file-like object, most often an object which implements the `io.IOBase` interface.
- A Python object, or reference to that object when writing, which consists in a sequence of bytes, such as a `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview` or `str`.

A data object can contain binary or text data. Differences on the underlying Python object are shown in this table:

| Variant | Binary mode | Text mode |
|---------|---|-|
| path    | `os.PathLike` | `os.PathLike` |
| file    | `io.RawIOBase` | `io.TextIOBase` |
| bytes   | `bytes`, `bytearray` or `memoryview` | `str` |

Furthermore, data objects are either readable or writable.


## Python API

The Python API used to handle data objects is agnostic to the underlying object.

```py
# For readable objects

with obj.open() as handle:
  data = handle.read()

handle = obj.open()
data = handle.read()
handle.close()


# For writable objects

with obj.open() as handle:
  handle.write(b"Hello, world!")

# or

handle = obj.open()
handle.write(b"Hello, world!")
handle.close()
```
