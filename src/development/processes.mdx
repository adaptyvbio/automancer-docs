## Creating a simple process

A _process_ is an object responsible for the execution of a step. The process attached to a step determines when the step terminates or fails, and whether it can be paused.

Practically, a process is a Python class with a `run()` function returning as an asynchronous iterator. `run()` is called immediately after creating an instance of the class, and only once. The step is marked as terminated once the iterator returns.

```py
from pr1 import BaseProcess

class Process(BaseProcess):
  async def run(self, initial_point, *, stack):
    yield ProcessExecEvent()
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    yield ProcessTerminationEvent()
```


## Sending events

The process' status is reported by sending an instance of one of the four `BaseProcessEvent` classes:

- `ProcessExecEvent` – A regular event.
- `ProcessPauseEvent` – An event indicating that the process is paused.
- `ProcessFailureEvent` – An event indicating that the process failed.
- `ProcessTerminationEvent` – An event indicating the process is terminated but not failed.

No event can be sent after sending a `ProcessFailureEvent` or a `ProcessTerinationEvent`. Furthermore, the iterator should terminate in the same iteration of the event loop. The iterator must not terminate without without one of these two events being yielded beforehand.

The process should send an event shortly after `run()` is called to immediately inform the user on the process' status. This is usually an event report a 0% progress, or a failure event if the requested operation cannot be carried out.


## Reporting progress

Progress can be logged and reported to the user by creating a _location_ object a providing it as a parameter to any of the four event constructors. If an event is sent with the default `location=None`, the location is assumed to be unchanged.

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ProcessLocation:
  progress: float

class Process(BaseProcess):
  async def run(self, ...):
    yield ProcessExecEvent(location=ProcessLocation(progress=0.0))
    await obj.run_step1()
    yield ProcessExecEvent(location=ProcessLocation(progress=0.5))
    await obj.run_step2()
    yield ProcessTerminationEvent(location=ProcessLocation(progress=1.0))
```

Note that any object contained in a event is assumed to be owned by that event. Therefore, changing the location object over time is undefined behavior. To limit this, you can set `frozen=True` to `@dataclass` if the location is a dataclass.

```py
class Process(BaseProcess):
  async def run(self, ...):
    location = ProcessLocation(progress=0.0)

    yield ProcessExecEvent(location=location)
    await obj.run_step1()

    location.progress = 0.5 # <- Updating the previously sent object is undefined behavior.
    yield ProcessExecEvent(location=location)
```


## Handling pause and resume

By default, the process is marked as non-pausable, therefore the user is cannot send a pause request. This behavior can be changed by sending a `ProcessExecEvent` with `pausable=True`. This property is retained, therefore sending subsequent events with the default value `pausable=None` will not have any effect.

```py
yield ProcessExecEvent(pausable=True)
# The process is now pausable.
yield ProcessExecEvent()
# The process is still pausable.
yield ProcessExecEvent(pausable=False)
# The process is not pausable anymore.
```

While the process is marked as pausable, the `pause()` method of the process can be called upon user interaction. Use this method to take action on the `run()` method's execution. From this point, `run()` is expected to yield `ProcessPauseEvent` soon. Other events can still be yielded until the process is paused or if a failure occurs in the meantime. If the pause procedure is expected to take more than one event loop iteration, the process should yield a `ProgramExecEvent` shortly after `pause()` is called to inform the user, and possibly more events until the the process is paused or terminates.

Once a `ProcessPauseEvent` is yielded, the process must not yield any event and must wait for a call to `resume()` to continue. An event should be yielded in the same iteration of the event loop as the call to `resume()`.

```py
class Process(BaseProcess):
  def pause(self):
    # Pause operations and have run() yield a ProcessPauseEvent()
    pass

  def resume(self):
    # Resume operations and have run() yield a ProcessExecEvent()
```

To act on the iterator from `pause()` and `resume()`, you can use some of asyncio's features, such as futures, tasks and events. In this example, the process is in charge of running the asynchronous function `run_complex_procedure()`. The process is paused by cancelling the task corresponding to `run_complex_procedure()` and resumed by triggering an `asyncio.Event`.

```py
class Process(BaseProcess):
  def pause(self):
    self.task.cancel()

  def resume(self):
    self.resumed_event.set()

  async def run(self, ...):
    self.resumed_event = asyncio.Event()

    while True:
      try:
        yield ProcessExecEvent(pausable=True)
        self.task = asyncio.create_task(run_complex_procedure())
      except asyncio.CancelledError:
        yield ProcessPauseEvent()

        self.resumed_event.unset()
        await self.resumed_event.wait()
      else:
        break

    yield ProcessTerminationEvent()
```
