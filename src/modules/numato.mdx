# Numato

Version: 2.0


## Introduction

This module adds support for certain Numato relay modules, such as the [16 Channel USB Relay Module](https://numato.com/product/16-channel-usb-relay-module/) and the [32 Channel USB Relay Module](https://numato.com/product/32-channel-usb-relay-module/).


## Usage

Each configured device generates one binary node per relay. The node id is `<device id>/<relay index>`, with the relay index starting at 0. For the example configuration, this leads to `RB/0`, `RB/1`, etc.


## Device configuration

This module follows the standard definition of devices. In addition to the standard properties of a device, it requires the following.

- `address` (string, required) – The address of the device, such as `/dev/tty.usbmodem1101` or `COM3`. This is the serial number of the device, which can be found on the back of the device. This is a required field.
- `model` (string, required) – The device model; only `relayboard` is permitted.
- `relay_count` (integer, required) – The number of relays.

An example is shown below.


```yml
devices:
  - id: RB
    label: Relay board
    kind: relayboard
    address: /dev/tty.usbmodem1101
    relay_count: 32
```
