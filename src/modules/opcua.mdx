# OPC-UA server

Version: 1.0


## Introduction

This module adds partial support for a server implementing the [OPC-UA protocol](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) using [opcua-asyncio](https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/opcua-asyncio).


## Usage

Each device configured generates a node for each entry in the `nodes` list, which can then be used by any node consumer.


## Device configuration

This module follows the standard definition of devices.  In addition to the standard properties of a device, it requires the following.

- `address` (string, required) – The address of the device, such as `opc.tcp://192.168.0.23:4840/a/b`.
- `nodes` (required) – A list that maps physical (i.e. OPC-UA) nodes to virtual (i.e. {Brand}) nodes, with the following properties:
  - `id` (identifier, required) – The id of the virtual node.
  - `location` (string, required) – The location of the physical node, such as `ns=3;i=2` or `ns=3;s="Foo bar".S02`.
  - `type` (string, required) – The type of the physical node, and thus of the virtual node. The following values are supported:
    - `bool` – A boolean value.

An example is shown below.

```yml
devices:
  - id: PLC
    address: opc.tcp://192.168.0.23:4840/a/b
    nodes:
      - id: S00
        location: ns=3;i=2
        type: bool
      - id: S01
        location: ns=3;i=3
        type: bool
      - id: S02
        location: ns=3;i=4
        type: bool
```
