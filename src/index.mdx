# {Brand}

{Brand} is a software application which makes it possible to automate lab protocols.

{Brand} is written in Python 3.11 for the backend and TypeScript 5.0 for the frontend.

## Features

- **Optional graphical user interface** – The application can be fully controlled from a graphical user interface. For more complex workflows, it is also possible to create a custom frontend by interfacing with {Brand}'s backend.
- **Ease of use** – Protocols are defined in a YAML-like language called {LangBrand} which can be learned in less than an hour.
- **Modular design** – Support for a new device in a setup can be added by installing a Python package. If no corresponding package is available, it is possible to create one and have it seamlessly integrate with the user interface with limited effort.
- **Reliability and reproducibility** – {Brand} has support for error recovery, real-time notifications and log recording, which can be used to determine where an experiment went wrong.
- **Remote connection** – Experiments can be controlled remotely, either through the graphical user interface or with a TCP socket. The connection is secured using TLS.
- **Platform support** – Linux, macOS, Windows
