# Getting started with writing protocols


## Introduction

Protocols in {Brand} are written as text files in a custom language called {LangBrand}, which is very close to YAML. The use of text files as opposed to visual editors allows protocols to be reproducible and source control management.

A simple protocol might look like the following:

```yml
protocol:
  actions:
    - wait: 10 min
      Thermostat.temperature: 10 degC
    - wait: 10 min
      Thermostat.temperature: 50 degC
  repeat: 10
```

In this example, we are controlling a thermostat, and alternating its setpoint 10 times between 10 and 50ºC. You might notice a few key features on {Brand}:

- All quantities must have an explicit unit, unless they are unitless. Here, we set the temperature the 10ºC we could have written 50ºF (as `50 degF`) with an identical result. For more information, see [Defining quantities](../units).
- {Brand} is modular by design: the `repeat`, `wait`, `actions` and `Thermostat.temperature` attributes are all defined by different modules. While the first three are fixed attributes, `Thermostat.temperature` has been generated by the device's module using a configuration provided by the user. Furthermore, it is possible to create your own module to extend the language. For more information, see [Module development](../../development).
- Protocols are defined as blocks which can be infinitely nested. In this example, the protocol structure generated from this file is:

  ```
  Repeat (repeat: 10)
  └── Sequence (actions:)
      ├── State (Thermostat.temperature: 10 degC)
      │   └── Timer (wait: 10 min)
      └── State (Thermostat.temperature: 50 degC)
          └── Timer (wait: 10 min)
  ```

  A simplified but equivalent structure is visible in the user interface. Understanding the structure of is not necessary for designing simple protocols. For details, see [Understanding protocol structure](../structure).


## Performing actions during protocol steps with processes

Each step in an {Brand} protocol must have a single role, known as a _process_, attached to it. A process describes what the system should do during this step. In particular, a process decides when a step terminates. In the example above, we only used a single process from the timer module, by making use of the `wait` attribute.

Other processes exist, and new ones can be declared by creating a new module. The core processes are listed below.

- Timer – Waits for a fixed duration. For details, see [Timer module](../../modules/timer).
- Query – Queries the user for data or otherwise waits for the user's confirmation. For details, see [Query module](../../modules/query).
- Asynchronous executor of Python tasks
- Synchronization primitives

Processes can also be used to control devices:

- File upload to an AWS S3 bucket is a process as it can take a significant amount of time to finish. A parallel block could be used to perform other actions in the meantime. For details, see [S3 module](../../modules/s3).
- Camera capture is a process which produces data.


## Associating state to protocol fragments

Every step in a protocol has an associated _state_ which describes how each device should behave during that step. State is not limited to a step however: a state can be defined for a subset of steps, or even for the entire protocol. For example, you might want to keep a device's value constant for the entire protocol, and also change another device's value at each step. At runtime, {Brand} computes the exact state of the step (or steps) which are currently running, while making sure to avoid unnecessary device value changes in the process.

Using the `Thermostat.temperature` attribute in the first example caused a state to be attached to each process. Let's reuse this attribute on other fragments of a protocol.

```yml
protocol:
  actions:
    - wait: 10 min
      Thermostate.temperature: 12 degC
    - wait: 20 min
  Thermostat.temperature: 10 degC
```

We have now set a value of 10ºC on the root block, meaning it will stay the default for the entire protocol. When starting the protocol, the step defined by the `wait: 10 min` process will be executed first. As a state is attached to that process, it will override the default of 10ºC with a value of 12ºC instead. Note that the thermostat won't be instructed to set its value to 10ºC, but will directly receive an instruction for 12ºC. In the second step, the default applies as no state has been attached to the `wait: 12 min` process. The thermostat will thus be instructed to set its value to 10ºC.

The system will wait for the device to confirm that it has set the temperature to its setpoint before starting each timer. This doesn't mean that the thermostat will have reached its target temperature, however.

State can be infinitely nested as a protocol becomes more complex. The following example makes uses of yet another nesting level.

```yml
protocol:
  actions:
    - wait: 10 min
    - wait: 10 min
      Thermostat.temperature: 12 degC
    - actions:
        - wait: 10 min
        - wait: 10 min
          Thermostat.temperature: 16 degC
      Thermostat.temperature: 14 degC
  Thermostat.temperature: 10 degC
```

There are four processes in this protocol, with temperatures increasing from 10ºC to 12, 14 and finally 16ºC.

It is possible to customize state execution using additional attributes. For details, see [Managing protocol state](../state).
