## General

_Expressions_ are small Python expressions that can be used in various locations in a protocol.


## Using static expressions

_Static expressions_ are executed at compile-time, in other words every time a protocol is compiled, even when not executed.

```yml
wait: ${{ 5 * unit.sec }}
```


## Using dynamic expressions

Unlike static expressions, _dynamic expressions_ are executed at runtime.

Dynamic expressions can contain compile-time components to guarantee the validity of parts of the expression earlier on. This is achieved with the `static()` function; its argument will be evaluated at compile-time and used at runtime. For example, the expression `${{ static(time()) - time() }}` will return the number of seconds from compilation to execution.

Certain dynamic expressions are executed once, whereas others are executed as frequently as possible.

```yml
steps:
  - wait: %{{ 5 * unit.min }} # Executed once
    expect: %{{ devices.Foo.bar > 36.0 }} # Executed every time variable 'Foo.bar' changes
```


## Using binding expressions

_Binding expressions_ are a special kind of expression used to reference a location for the output of an operation. For example, after capturing a picture, we might want to process the captured data rather than saving it directly in a file. This can be achieved using a binding expression, in the form `@{{ ... }}`.

```yml
actions:
  - Camera.capture:
      exposure: 300 ms
      output: @{{ data }}
```

In this example, we are saving the captured data into the `data` variable to process it later on. The type of the variable is set by the capture module.

There are five binding expression types:

- _Named bindings_ write the received value to a variable and are written in the form `${{ <var> }}`, e.g. `${{ foo }}`.
- _Attribute bindings_ write the value to an attribute and are written in the form `${{ <expr>.<attr> }}`, e.g. `${{ foo.bar }}`. The attribute will be set using `setattr()`.
- _Property bindings_ write the value to a property and are written in the form `${{ <expr>[<expr>] }}`, e.g. `${{ foo['bar'] }}` or `${{ foo[5] }}`.
- _Null bindings_ discard the value and are written as `${{ _ }}`. They are variant of named bindings where the variable's name is `_`. Unlike regular Python, the data will be actually discarded rather than set to this variable.
- _Tuple bindings_ are a special type of binding used to match a tuple. They are composed of zero or more children bindings which will be matched to their corresponding sub-values. In the expression `@{{ x, y.a, _ }}`, the first and second items of the tuple will be set to `x` and `y.a`, respectively a named and an attribute binding. The third item will be discarded. An empty tuple `${{ () }}` is also valid when receiving an empty tuple.

List bindings are not supported.

Sub-expressions contained inside bindings are not limited to simple variables or literals. Consider the following examples:

- `@{{ {}['a'] }}` – Here the received value will be discarded because the dictionary is not saved. A warning will be issued in this situation.
- `@{{ obj.data[index * 2 + 1] }}`
- `@{{ pt.x, (_, pt.y), pt.z }}`

All expressions are dynamic, thus executed at runtime. Static components can still be used as described in the previous section, for instance `%{{ items[static(index * 2)] }}`.

## Using global variables

Expressions have access to all variables returned by `globals()`, as well as a few additional ones, detailed in this table.
