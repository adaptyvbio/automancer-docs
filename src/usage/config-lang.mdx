# {title}


## Introduction

{Brand} protocols are defined in {LangBrand}, a configuration language close to YAML. It is designed to be lightweight and human-readable. It is also used in setup configuration files.

The extension of {LangBrand} is `.pcrl` and its media (MIME) type is `text/pcrl`. The recommended case is snake case, i.e. `snake_case`.


## Examples

The following {LangBrand}:

```yml
# A comment

database:
  server: 192.168.1.1
  ports: [8000, 8001, 8002]
  connection_max: 5000
  options: { enabled: true }

servers:
  - name: alpha
    ip: 10.0.0.1
    dc: eqdc10
  - name: beta
    ip: 10.0.0.2
    dc: eqdc10
```

Maps to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "server": "192.168.1.1",
    "ports": [8000, 8001, 8002],
    "connection_max": 5000,
    "options": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "alpha",
      "ip": "10.0.1",
      "dc": "eqdc10"
    },
    {
      "name": "beta",
      "ip": "10.0.2",
      "dc": "eqdc10"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Comparison with YAML

{LangBrand} is conceptually close to YAML and YAML's syntax highlighting definitions can be used to highlight {LangBrand}, such as in snippets embedded within a Markdown file. When taking a closer look, however, YAML and {LangBrand} have major differences:

- Values in {LangBrand} are either a dictionary, a list, a string or null.
  ```yml
  foo: null  # foo is None
  foo: 32    # foo is 32
  foo: false # foo is false
  ```
- {LangBrand} has no support for nested dictionaries on a single line.
  ```yml
  foo:
    bar: 23

  # or

  foo: { bar: 23 }

  # instead of

  foo: bar: 34
  ```
- {LangBrand} has no support for JSON structures.
- {LangBrand} has no support for anchors and references.
- {LangBrand} has no support for data typing.
- {LangBrand} has no support for multiple documents.
- {LangBrand} only has the `|` syntax for multiline strings but no support for `>`.
  ```yml
  key: |
    Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
    With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
    ...

  # instead of

  key: >
    Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
    With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
    ...
  ```
- {LangBrand} enforces two-spaces indentation.
- {LangBrand} requires one more indentation level when dealing with lists of dictionary of lists.
  ```yml
  - a:
      - b

  # instead of

  - a:
    - b
  ```
