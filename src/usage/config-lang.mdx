# {title}


## Introduction

{Brand} heavily relies on a configuration language named {LangBrand} in the following files:

- setups' configuration
- protocols
- configuration files specific to a module (e.g. a file describing )

The extension of {LangBrand} is `.pcrl` and its media (MIME) type is `text/pcrl`. The recommended case is snake case, i.e. `snake_case`.


## Examples

The following {LangBrand}:

```yml
database:
  server: 192.168.1.1
  ports:
    - 8000
    - 8001
    - 8002
  connection_max: 5000
  enabled: true

servers:
  alpha:
    ip: 10.0.0.1
    dc: eqdc10
  beta:
    ip: 10.0.0.2
    dc: eqdc10
```

Maps to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "server": "192.168.1.1",
    "ports": ["8000", "8001", "8002"],
    "connection_max": "5000",
    "enabled": "true"
  },
  "servers": {
    "alpha": {
      "ip": "10.0.1",
      "dc": "eqdc10"
    },
    "beta": {
      "ip": "10.0.2",
      "dc": "eqdc10"
    }
  }
}
```

Note in particular how all values with a type other than string are considered to be strings. They must be converted to their appropriate type by the downstream consumer.


## Comparison with YAML

{LangBrand} is conceptually close to YAML and YAML's syntax highlighting definitions can be used to highlight {LangBrand}, such as in snippets embedded within a Markdown file. When taking a closer look, however, YAML and {LangBrand} have major differences:

- Values in {LangBrand} are either a dictionary, a list, a string or null.
  ```yml
  foo:       # foo is None
  foo: 32    # foo is "32"
  foo: false # foo is "false"
  ```
- {LangBrand} has no support for dictionaries of dictionaries on a single line.
  ```yml
  foo:
    bar: 23

  # instead of

  foo: bar: 34
  ```
- {LangBrand} has no support for JSON structures.
- {LangBrand} has no support for anchors and references.
- {LangBrand} has no support for data typing.
- {LangBrand} has no support for multiple documents.
- The {LangBrand} syntax for multiline strings requires a vertical bar on every line:
  ```yml
  key:
    | Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
    | With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
    | ...

  # instead of

  key: | # or >
    Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
    With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
    ...
  ```
- {LangBrand} enforces two-spaces indentation.
- {LangBrand} requires one more indentation level when dealing with lists of dictionary of lists.
  ```yml
  - a:
      - b

  # instead of

  - a:
    - b
  ```
