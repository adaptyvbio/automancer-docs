# Managing setups

A _setup_, internally known as a _host_, is an object which defines a physical setup.


## Adding a setup

Setups can be added by clicking **New setup** on the startup window.

Every setup depends on a Python binary, which can be the system's installation or an embedded binary. All Python packages present in this installation's import path will be searched for modules.

If an error occurs during launch, an alert modal will be displayed. If the setup is local, the error will be printed to a log file. Log files can be found from the startup menu: **Right click on a setup → Reveal logs in explorer**.


## Installing modules

Modules can be installed as any Python project, using `pip` or another package manager.

```sh
$ pip install pr1_ksp
$ pip install path/to/module
```

Installed modules will be automatically loaded and enabled when the setup is launched. Note also that a project can contain multiple modules.


## Configuring a setup

When running a standalone application, the setup's configuration can be found from the startup menu: **Right click on a setup → Reveal settings in explorer → Open `setup.yml`**.

The following root attributes are available:

- `id` (identifier, required) – A unique id associated to this setup. Automatically generated.
- `name` (string, required) – The name of the setup. Automatically generated with the computer's name.
- `units` (dictionary) – A dictionary listing the configuration of every module. See [Module](#) for details.
- `version` (string, required) – The version of the configuration's schema, for backwards compatibility. Automatically generated and updated.


### Modules

The configuration of modules is provided in the setup configuration file as key-value pairs where the key is the module's namespace.

```yml
units:
  ksp:
    # <- Options regarding module initialization here
    options:
      # <- Options passed to the module here
```

The following options for module initialization are available:

- `development` (boolean) – Whether to load the module in [development mode](#). Defaults to false.
- `enabled` (boolean) – Whether the module is enabled. Defaults to true.
- `module` (string) – The module's name (e.g. `a.b.c`) indicating where to find the module if it is [not registered as an entry point](#) but present in `sys.path`. This is for development only. If `path` is also present, `module` will only be used to name the module but not to locate it.
- `options` (object) – Options passed to the module. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
- `path` (string) – The module's absolute path (e.g. `/path/to/a/b/c.py`) indicating where to find the module if it is not registered as an entry point and not present in `sys.path`. This is for development only.

By default, all modules installed in `sys.path` are loaded and enabled even if they are not mentioned in the configuration.


### Devices

Several modules interact with external devices and follow a similar pattern when defining the configuration of these devices. This configuration starts with a `devices` attribute in the module options, which defines a list of devices. Each device can the following properties:

- `id` (identifier, required) – A string unique to this device among all devices in the setup. This id will be used to reference the device in protocols.
- `label` (string) – The name of the device. Defaults to a name provided by the device itself, the name of its manufacturer, the device's model, its serial number, its `id`, or a similar string.
- `model` (string, sometimes required) – The model of the device. This can sometimes be detected automatically by communicating with the device or using information from the underlying protocol, such as the product id in the case of USB.
- One or more options to locate the device, such as:
  - `address` (number or string) – The address of the device, such as an IP address and port (e.g. `17.244.221.152:6513`), a full address with credentials (e.g. `user:pass@server.net`), a serial port (e.g. `COM3` or `/dev/tty.usbmodem1101`) or a USB bus address (e.g. `5`).
  - `serial` (string) – The serial number of the device, as defined by the manufacturer.
- Other options depending on the module and `model`.

Below is an example:

```yml
units:
  ksp:
    options:
      devices:
        - id: RA1
          label: Rocket alpha 1
          model: alpha
          address: LaunchingPads/1
          # <- Other options here
        - id: RA2
          # ...
```
